# Fund Me Hardhat Project

This contract was created using the `Hardhat` development framework and following a `32 hour YouTube course by Patrick Collins`. 

It is a Solidity smart contract that enables users to contribute ETH to it. It tracks the contributions made by each user and includes a function to update a list of top funders, who are the users that have contributed the most amount of ETH. In order to contribute, users must contribute at least a minimum amount of USD, which is specified by the MINIMUM_USD constant. The contract uses a price feed contract to convert ETH values to USD values. Only the owner of the contract is able to call certain functions that are restricted by the onlyOwner modifier.

This repository contains the backend code for the FundMe project. There is a separate repository for the basic frontend code.
